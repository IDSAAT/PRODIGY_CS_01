# PRODIGY_CS_01
This is a tool made to ensure that data is been encrypted to avoid unauthorized parties from having access to text or data which isn't meant to be seen by them.

Encryption & Decryption Tool (Python + Tkinter GUI)
📌 Overview

This project is a simple yet powerful text encryption and decryption tool built using Python, Tkinter, and Cryptography’s Fernet module.
It allows users to:

Generate a secure encryption key

Load an existing key

Encrypt any text message

Decrypt encrypted text

Save and manage key files securely

The program provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface suitable for beginners and anyone who wants to quickly secure their text data.

🚀 Features
🔐 Encryption

Uses Fernet symmetric encryption (industry-standard)

Converts plain text into secure encrypted text

Prevents unauthorized access without the correct key

🔓 Decryption

Decrypts previously encrypted text

Validates keys to avoid errors

Shows clear error messages for invalid key or corrupted text

🔑 Key Management

Generate and save a new secure .key file

Load an existing encryption key

Keys are stored externally to ensure strong security practices

🖥️ Graphical User Interface (Tkinter)

Clean and easy-to-use layout

Input fields for text

Buttons for all key operations

Output display area for showing encrypted or decrypted results

📂 Project Structure
Encryption-Tool/
│── encryption_gui.py       # Main program file with Tkinter GUI
│── README.md               # Project documentation
│── *.key                   # (Optional) Encryption key files generated by user

📦 Requirements

Make sure you have the following installed:

✔ Python 3.x
✔ Required Python libraries:

Install dependencies using:pip install cryptography
Tkinter is included by default in most Python installations.

▶️ How to Run the Program

Download or clone the project folder

Open a terminal in the project directory

Run the script:python encryption_gui.py
The Tkinter window will launch automatically.

🧠 How It Works

The tool uses Fernet encryption, which provides:

AES-128 in CBC mode

HMAC for authentication

URL-safe base64 encoding

Meaning your encrypted messages are both secure and verifiable.

🖼️ Screenshots

(Optional — you can add a screenshot of your GUI here)

🔒 Security Notes

Keep your .key files safe and private

Anyone with your key can decrypt your messages

Losing the key means losing access to decrypt your data
